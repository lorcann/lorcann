👋 Hi, I’m @lorcann
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, SEO optimisation, and combining tech with the equine industry. I also have a strong passion for illustration and animation.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Python and exploring new frameworks and tools for WordPress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative web projects, especially those in the equine space, or any projects that bridge technology with art and design.
